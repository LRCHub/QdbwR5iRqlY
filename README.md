```lrc
[00:29.73] I know you're sick and tired of words
[00:33.31] Floating 'round the universe in spite
[00:42.97] Of all the time and all the work
[00:46.49] You put in, I know it hurts, and I
[00:55.97] I've seen you lose your ground to lowly skies
[01:02.79] Fell too fast, can't get the chance to cry
[01:09.15] Who will you ever be without their eyes?
[01:15.70] What good's your voice if no one really minds?
[01:38.70] 
[01:22.91] Settle down 'til the moment comes around
[01:35.99] There's a plan you won't understand for now
[01:57.49] 
[01:45.11] I was going so crazy, couldn't run
[01:47.83] I know there's a god that's withholding His help
[01:51.51] I know You made me, but I hate myself
[01:55.04] And I know, when I know that it's buried somewhere else
[02:00.96] And I know that I'll find my moment
[02:08.10] 'Cause what good's your voice if no one really minds?
[02:34.60] 
[02:43.22] When I was a child, spoke like a child
[02:56.53] When I was a child, I became a man
[03:09.96] When I was a child, thought like a child
[03:29.96] 
[03:35.03] Oh, Lord, Thy kingdom come
[03:41.77] Yes, you're an awesome God, Thy will be done
[03:48.60] Oh, Lord, the battle is won
[03:55.40] On Earth and Heaven, praised be the Son
